# System Design Learning Repository

This repository is a structured, practical guide to learning system design from the ground up. Instead of jumping straight into large-scale architectures, it builds the fundamentals first, then gradually expands into real-world systems and interview-level case studies.

The content is organized into **Modules**, and each module is broken down into clear, focused **Sections**.

## Module 1: Core Networking & Infrastructure

Before designing any system, it's essential to understand how machines communicate, how data moves, and how the internet really works. This module covers all the foundational networking concepts needed before diving deeper into architecture.

### Sections
1. **IP Addressing**
2. **DNS**
3. **OSI Model**
4. **Layer 4 vs Layer 7**
5. **TCP & UDP**
6. **HTTP & HTTPS**
7. **Proxies**
8. **Reverse Proxies**
9. **Load Balancers**
10. **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**
11. **Clustering**
12. **Storage Systems**

## Module 2: Databases & Storage Layer

A strong understanding of data systems is at the heart of system design. This module explores different types of databases, how they store and retrieve data, and how they scale in distributed environments.

### Sections
1. **Database Types (Relational & NoSQL)**
2. **Indexing**
3. **Normalization & Denormalization**
4. **ACID & BASE**
5. **Consistency Models**
6. **CAP Theorem**
7. **Transactions & Distributed Transactions**
8. **Sharding & Partitioning**
9. **Consistent Hashing**
10. **Replication**
11. **Data Versioning**

## Module 3: System Architecture

This module focuses on the design patterns and architectural choices behind modern backend systems. It introduces communication styles, architectural approaches, and interface standards used in real systems.

### Sections
1. **Monolithic Architecture**
2. **Microservices**
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
4. **Message Brokers**
5. **Publish/Subscribe**
6. **CQRS**
7. **API Gateways**
8. **REST, GraphQL, gRPC**
9. **Long Polling, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events**

## Module 4: Distributed Systems & Reliability

Once systems grow, new challenges appear: resilience, fault isolation, service discovery, and operational guarantees. This module covers the patterns and principles used to keep distributed systems reliable.

### Sections
1. **Geohashing & Spatial Indexing**
2. **Quadtree**
3. **Circuit Breakers**
4. **Rate Limiting**
5. **Service Discovery**
6. **SLA / SLO / SLI**
7. **Disaster Recovery**
8. **Virtual Machines & Containers**
9. **OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SSO**
10. **SSL / TLS / mTLS**

## Module 5: System Design Case Studies

All the fundamentals come together here. This module breaks down commonly asked system design interview problems and explains how to think through them step-by-step.

### Sections
1. **URL Shortener**
2. **WhatsApp**
3. **Twitter / X**
4. **Netflix**
5. **Uber**
